# Work day scheduler

## Description
This website provides a daily planner for users.
The current date is displayed at the top of the page for convenience
The planner provides time blocks for each hour of the standard business day (9 a.m. to 5 p.m., including the 5 p.m. hour).
The timeblocks are color-coded based on whether they are in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green).

The user can enter an event into each time block, and then store the result in local storage by clicking a save button.
The events that the user stores persist after refreshing the page or closing and re-opening it.
